# AI & Machine Learning Projects

This folder contains a collection of data science and machine learning projects completed as part of my graduate-level coursework. Each project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow, from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to model building and strategic recommendations.

### 1. Easy Visa: Visa Approval Prediction Model

* **Objective:** To build a predictive model that helps a company identify visa candidates with the highest probability of application approval, thereby reducing costs and effort spent on candidates likely to be denied.
* **Approach:** The project involved comprehensive EDA to understand the factors influencing visa status, followed by data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the training and evaluation of multiple classification models. The final model was selected based on its ability to accurately predict "Denied" cases (F1-score).
* **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest), XGBoost.
* **Outcome:** The XGBoost model was identified as the top performer. The final recommendation was for the company to use this model as a screening tool to prioritize visa candidates, optimizing resource allocation and improving the efficiency of their application process.

### 2. FoodHub: Exploratory Data Analysis & Growth Strategy

* **Objective:** To analyze the historical order data of a food delivery company ("FoodHub") to understand its business performance, identify key operational trends, and provide data-driven recommendations for growth.
* **Approach:** This project focused heavily on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer critical business questions regarding order volume, customer behavior, cuisine popularity, and the relationship between delivery time and customer ratings.
* **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.
* **Outcome:** The analysis produced several actionable insights, including identifying the most profitable cuisines, peak ordering hours for targeted promotions, and the negative correlation between long delivery times and low ratings. Key recommendations included optimizing restaurant partnerships in high-demand areas and improving delivery logistics.

### 3. Thera Bank: Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction

* **Objective:** To build a machine learning model for a bank to predict which of their existing customers are most likely to accept a personal loan offer, thereby improving the efficiency and conversion rate of their marketing campaigns.
* **Approach:** The dataset was analyzed and preprocessed, followed by the training of several classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) to distinguish potential loan acceptors from non-acceptors.
* **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
* **Outcome:** A final model was recommended that could effectively target a smaller, more qualified group of customers, allowing the bank to significantly increase campaign conversion rates while reducing marketing spend.
