# Greg Burns - Data Analytics & AI/ML Portfolio

The discipline, resilience, and mission-first ethos I learned as a U.S. Marine have been the foundation of my entire career. They guided me through more than a decade of leading complex enterprise software projects for global firms like IBM and Deloitte, and they are the core of my current mission: a full pivot into the world of Data Analytics and Machine Learning.

After a planned career break, I have dedicated the last several months to a structured plan of updating my skills and building this portfolio. This repository contains a collection of my recent work, organized by project type. Please feel free to explore the projects below.

## Projects Overview

### ➡️ [AI/ML Internship Project: End-to-End Computer Vision Pipeline](FreeFuse_Project/)

A comprehensive project from my internship at FreeFuse demonstrating the design and implementation of a full data pipeline. start]This project involved processing raw video, researching and evaluating multiple computer vision models (including YOLOv8, DETR, and Faster R-CNN) [cite: 1, 2, 3][cite_start], and delivering strategic insights through data visualization[cite: 4]. [cite_start]The work also included developing a standalone utility for HIPAA-compliant video face blurring[cite: 5].

* **Key Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, YOLO, DeepSORT, RoboFlow API.

### ➡️ [Competitive Data Science Projects](hackathons/)

A collection of projects from competitive hackathons, showcasing end-to-end machine learning workflows under tight deadlines. [cite_start]This includes a **2nd place finish (out of 107 teams)** in a regression challenge to predict restaurant turnover [cite: 6] [cite_start]and a classification model for Kaggle's "Spaceship Titanic" survival prediction competition[cite: 7].

* **Key Technologies:** Python, CatBoost, XGBoost, Optuna, Scikit-learn, Ensemble Methods.

### ➡️ [Foundational Case Studies in Machine Learning](AI_ML_projects/)

A series of case studies from my graduate coursework focused on solving common business problems. [cite_start]These projects cover exploratory data analysis for a food delivery service [cite: 8][cite_start], building a predictive model for visa application approvals [cite: 9][cite_start], and developing a model to identify customers likely to accept a personal loan offer[cite: 10].

* **Key Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest), XGBoost.

## Technical Skills Summary

Across these projects, I have demonstrated hands-on proficiency with a modern data science stack:

* **Languages:** Python, SQL
* **Data Analysis & ML:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Predictive Analytics, Feature Engineering
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, YOLOv8, DETR, Faster R-CNN, insightface
* **ML Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow & TensorFlow Hub, Hugging Face Transformers
* **MLOps & Tools:** Git, Docker, RoboFlow API, Jupyter Notebooks
