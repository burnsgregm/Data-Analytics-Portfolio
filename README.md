# Greg Burns - Data Analytics & AI/ML Portfolio

The discipline, resilience, and mission-first ethos I learned as a U.S. Marine have been the foundation of my entire career. After more than a decade in enterprise consulting, I am pivoting into the world of data, combining deep project management experience with new skills in data analysis and machine learning.
