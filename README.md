Of course. Now that we have the detailed, lower-level README files for each project folder, we can create a powerful top-level README that serves as a clean, professional "table of contents" for your entire portfolio.

Here is the README.md for your main Data-Analytics-Portfolio repository, in Markdown format.

# Greg Burns - Data Analytics & AI/ML Portfolio

[cite_start]The discipline, resilience, and mission-first ethos I learned as a U.S. Marine have been the foundation of my entire career[cite: 173]. [cite_start]They guided me through more than a decade of leading complex enterprise software projects for global firms like IBM and Deloitte, and they are the core of my current mission: a full pivot into the world of Data Analytics and Machine Learning[cite: 174].

[cite_start]After a planned career break, I have dedicated the last several months to a structured plan of updating my skills and building this portfolio[cite: 175]. This repository contains a collection of my recent work, organized by project type. Please feel free to explore the projects below.

## Projects Overview

### ➡️ [AI/ML Internship Project: End-to-End Computer Vision Pipeline](FreeFuse_Project/)

A comprehensive project from my internship at FreeFuse demonstrating the design and implementation of a full data pipeline. [cite_start]This project involved processing raw video, researching and evaluating multiple computer vision models (including YOLOv8, DETR, and Faster R-CNN) [cite: 1, 2, 3][cite_start], and delivering strategic insights through data visualization[cite: 4]. [cite_start]The work also included developing a standalone utility for HIPAA-compliant video face blurring[cite: 5].

* **Key Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, YOLO, DeepSORT, RoboFlow API.

### ➡️ [Competitive Data Science Projects](hackathons/)

A collection of projects from competitive hackathons, showcasing end-to-end machine learning workflows under tight deadlines. [cite_start]This includes a **2nd place finish (out of 107 teams)** in a regression challenge to predict restaurant turnover [cite: 6] [cite_start]and a classification model for Kaggle's "Spaceship Titanic" survival prediction competition[cite: 7].

* **Key Technologies:** Python, CatBoost, XGBoost, Optuna, Scikit-learn, Ensemble Methods.

### ➡️ [Foundational Case Studies in Machine Learning](AI_ML_projects/)

A series of case studies from my graduate coursework focused on solving common business problems. [cite_start]These projects cover exploratory data analysis for a food delivery service [cite: 8][cite_start], building a predictive model for visa application approvals [cite: 9][cite_start], and developing a model to identify customers likely to accept a personal loan offer[cite: 10].

* **Key Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest), XGBoost.
